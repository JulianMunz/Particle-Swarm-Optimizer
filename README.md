# Particle-Swarm-Optimizer

In computational science, particle swarm optimization is a computational method that optimizes a problem by iteratively trying to improve a candidate solution with regard to a given measure of quality. This is accomplished by using a population of particles, called a swarm, which communicate in order to explore the search space. This optimization technique models bird flocking behaviour in order to find the global maxima of a mathematical function.
